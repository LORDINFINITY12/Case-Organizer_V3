  * Wired internal messaging to send notification emails asynchronously,
    caching SMTP credentials and adding optional timing logs so slow servers
    no longer block the UI while still surfacing failures.
  * Added a password visibility toggle on the login form to trim user entry
    mistakes without weakening validation.
  * Queued password-reset emails for both users and admins, sharing the new
    email pipeline improvements.

case-organizer (3.0.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Finalized Manage Case workflow: File Category dropdown now highlights
    "Invoices", subcategory disables with clear "(not used for Invoices)"
    messaging, and the Generate Invoice button remains greyed out until a
    case is selected.
  * Introduced the full invoice generator, available both as a standalone
    workflow and directly from case management so firms can raise documents
    in context or independently as needed.
  * Streamlined note handling: the modal only exposes Save/Cancel while you
    are editing, the Manage Case note button appears solely when a Note.json
    exists for the chosen case, and it stays hidden otherwise.
  * Invoice generation now writes PDFs both to the global Invoices archive
    and into the selected caseâ€™s own Invoices folder; caret positioning in
    amount fields no longer jumps unexpectedly while typing.
  * UI polish: added explicit disabled styling for secondary buttons and
    tightened keyboard-focus behaviour to keep actions visually consistent.
